<br>

There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out of the dark

Finally I can see you crystal clear

Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I leave with every piece of you

Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out of the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could've had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat

<br>

Baby I have no story to be told

But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair

Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could've had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat

We could've had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

But you played it with beating

<br>

Throw your soul through every open door

Count your blessings to find what you look for

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

<br>

We could've had it all

We could've had it all yeah

It all

It all

It all

We could've had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat

<br>

We could've had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

But you played it 

You played it

You played it 

You played it to the beat

<br>
