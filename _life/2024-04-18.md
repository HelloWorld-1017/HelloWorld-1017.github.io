Ever wonder about what he's doing

How it all turned to lies

Sometimes I think that it's better to never ask why

<br>

Where there is desire

There is gonna be a flame

Where there is a flame

Someone's bound to get burned

But just because it burns

Doesn't mean you're gonna die

You've gotta get up and try try try

You've gotta get up and try try try

You've gotta get up and try try try

<br>

Funny how the heart can be deceiving

More than just a couple times

Why do we fall in love so easy

Even when it's not right

yeah yeah

<br>

Where there is desire

There is gonna be a flame

Where there is a flame

Someone's bound to get burned

But just because it burns

Doesn't mean you're gonna die

You've gotta get up and try try try

You've gotta get up and try try try

You've gotta get up and try try try

<br>

Ever worried that it might be ruined

And does it make you wanna cry

When you're out there doing what you're doing

Are you just getting by

Tell me are you just getting by by by

<br>

Where there is desire

There is gonna be a flame

Where there is a flame

Someone's bound to get burned

But just because it burns

Doesn't mean you're gonna die

You've gotta get up and try try try

You gotta get up and try try try

You gotta get up and try try try

You gotta get up and try try try

You gotta get up and try try try

Gotta get up and try try try

Gotta get up and try try try

<br>

You gotta get up and try try try

You gotta get up and try try try
