A <i class="term">figure of speech</i> or <i class="term">rhetorical figure</i> is a word or phrase that <i class="emphasize">intentionally</i> deviates from straightforward language use or literal meaning to produce a rhetorical or intensified effect (emotionally, aesthetically, intellectually, etc.).[^1]

**Schemes**

Schemes are words or phrases whose syntax, sequence, or pattern occurs in a manner that varies from an ordinary usage.

- **Parallelism** /ˈpærəlelɪzəm/: Parallelism is a rhetorical device that compounds words or phrases that have equivalent meanings so as to create a definite pattern.[^2]

**Tropes**

Tropes are words or phrases whose contextual meaning differs from the manner or sense in which they are ordinarily used.

- **Allegory**[^3] /ˈæləɡɔːri/: A story, play, poem, picture, or other work in which the characters and events represent particular qualities or ideas that relate to morals, religion, or politics.[^9]
- **Allusion**[^4] /əˈluːʒn/: Something that is said or written that is intended to make you think of a particular thing or person.[^10]
- **Analogy** /əˈnælədʒi/: Analogy is a comparison or correspondence between two things (or two groups of things) because of a third element that they are considered to share.[^5]
- **Irony** /ˈaɪrəni/: Irony, in its broadest sense, is the juxtaposition of what on the surface appears to be the case and what is actually the case or to be expected. It typically figures as a rhetorical device and literary technique. In some philosophical contexts, however, it takes on a larger significance as an entire way of life.[^8]
- **Metaphor**[^7] /ˈmetəfər/: An expression, often found in literature, that describes a person or object by referring to something that is considered to have similar characteristics to that person or object.[^11]
- **Rhetorical /rɪˈtɔːrɪkl/ question**: A rhetorical question is a question asked for a purpose other than to obtain information. In many cases it may be intended to start a discourse, as a means of displaying or emphasizing the speaker's or author's opinion on a topic.[^6]
