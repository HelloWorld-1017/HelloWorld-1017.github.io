## Chapter I

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

Another lesson I learned early is that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can’t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market to-day has happened before and will happen again. I’ve never forgotten that. I suppose I really manage to remember when and how it happened. The fact that I remember that way is my way of capitalizing experience.

## Chapter III

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

I didn’t have as many interesting experiences as you might imagine. I mean, the process of learning how to speculate does not seem dramatic at this distance. I went broke several times, and that is never pleasant, but the way I lost money is the way everybody loses money who loses money in Wall Street. Speculation is a hard and trying business, and a speculator must be on the job all the time or he’ll soon have no job to be on.

## Chapter V

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

And right here let me say one thing: After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions dollars I want to tell you this: It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight! It is no trick at all to be right on the market. You always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets. I’ve known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine that is, they made no real money out of it. Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon. I found it one of the hardest things to learn. But it is only after a stock operator has firmly grasped this that he can make big money. It is literally true that millions come easier to a trader after he knows how to trade than hundreds did in the days of his ignorance.

A summary from Lindsay[^1]:

- As long as a stock is acting right, and the market is right, do not be in a hurry to take profits.
- End trades when it is clear that the trend you are profiting from is over.
- Don not listen to tips.
- Only enter a trade after the action of the market confirms your opinion and then enter promptly. Do not trade every day of every year.
- Markets are never wrong -- opinions often are.
