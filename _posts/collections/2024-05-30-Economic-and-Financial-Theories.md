## Pareto efficiency (Pareto improvement)

> [Pareto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency)
>
> - The concept is named after Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923), an Italian civil engineer and economist, who used the concept in his studies of economic efficiency and income distribution.

In <i class="term">welfare economics</i>, a <i class="term">Pareto improvement</i> formalizes the idea of an outcome being "better in every possible way". A change is called a Pareto improvement <i class="emphasize">if it leaves everyone in a society better-off</i> (or at least as well-off as they were before). A situation is called <i class="term">Pareto efficient</i> or <i class="term">Pareto optimal</i> if <i class="emphasize">all possible Pareto improvements</i> have already been made; in other words, there are <i class="emphasize">no longer any ways left</i> to make one person better-off, without making some other person worse-off.

In <i class="term">social choice theory</i>, the same concept is sometimes called the <i class="term">unanimity principle</i>, which says that if everyone in a society (non-strictly) prefers A to B, society <i class="emphasize">as a whole</i> also non-strictly prefers A to B.

The <i class="term">Pareto front</i> consists of all Pareto-efficient situations.

In addition to the context of efficiency in <i class="term">allocation</i>, the concept of Pareto efficiency also arises in the context of efficiency in <i class="term">production</i> vs. x-inefficiency: a set of outputs of goods is Pareto-efficient if there is no feasible re-allocation of productive inputs such that output of <i class="emphasize">one</i> product <i class="emphasize">increases</i> while the outputs of <i class="emphasize">all other</i> goods either <i class="emphasize">increase</i> or <i class="emphasize">remain the same</i>.

Besides economics, the notion of Pareto efficiency has also been applied to <i class="emphasize">selecting alternatives</i> in engineering and biology. Each option is first assessed, under multiple criteria, and then a subset of options is identified with the property that no other option can categorically outperform the specified option. It is a statement of impossibility of improving one variable <i class="emphasize">without harming other variables</i> in the subject of <i class="term">multi-objective optimization</i> (also termed <i class="term">Pareto optimization</i>).

## Dog walking theory (by Andre Kostolany)

... As famous economist Andre Kostolany once said, the relationship between the <i class="emphasize">stock market</i> and the <i class="emphasize">economy</i> is like a man walking his dog. The dog follows his master, and yet is always ahead of him—just like the stock market is always ahead of the economy, because it’s role is to anticipate the future.

## Gresham's law (Good Money)

> [Gresham's law (Good Money)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law)
>
> - The law was named in 1857 by economist Henry Dunning Macleod after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. Gresham had urged Queen Elizabeth to restore confidence in then-debased English currency.
> - The concept was thoroughly defined in Renaissance Europe by Nicolaus Copernicus and known centuries earlier in classical Antiquity, the Near East, and China.

In economics, <i class="term">Gresham's law</i> is a monetary principle stating that <i class="emphasize">"bad money drives out good"</i>. For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar <i class="term">face value</i>, the more valuable commodity will gradually disappear from circulation.

## Impossible trinity

> [Impossible trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity)
>
> - The concept was developed independently by both John Marcus Fleming in 1962 and Robert Alexander Mundell in different articles between 1960 and 1963.

The <i class="term">impossible trinity</i> (also known as the <i class="term">impossible trilemma</i>, the <i class="term">monetary trilemma</i> or the <i class="term">Unholy Trinity</i>) is a concept in international economics and international political economy which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:

- a <i class="emphasize">fixed</i> foreign exchange rate
- <i class="emphasize">free</i> capital movement (absence of <i class="term">capital controls</i>)
- an <i class="emphasize">independent</i> monetary policy

It is both a hypothesis based on the <i class="term">uncovered interest rate parity</i> condition, and a finding from empirical studies where governments that have tried to simultaneously pursue all three goals have failed. 

Historically in advanced economies, the periods pre-1914 and 1970–2014 were characterized by stable foreign exchange rates and free capital movement, whereas <i class="term">monetary autonomy</i> was limited. The periods 1914–1924 and 1950–1969 had restrictions on capital movement (e.g. capital controls), but exchange rate stability and monetary autonomy were present.

## Ratchet effect

> [Ratchet Effect: Definition and Examples in Economics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratchet-effect.asp).

The <i class="term">ratchet effect</i> is an economic process that is difficult to reverse <i class="emphasize">once it is underway or has already occurred</i>. A ratchet is an analogy to a mechanical ratchet, which spins one way but not the other, in an economic process that tends to <i class="emphasize">only work one way</i>. The results or side effects of the process may reinforce the cause by creating or altering incentives and expectations among participants.

A ratchet effect is closely related to the idea of a <i class="term">positive feedback loop</i>. In addition, like releasing a mechanical ratchet used to compress a spring, the reversal of an economic process that involves a ratchet effect may be rapid, forceful, and difficult to control.

## Lipstick effect

> [Lipstick Effect: Definition, Theory, Value as Economic Indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lipstick-effect.asp).

The <i class="term">lipstick effect</i> is when consumers <i class="emphasize">still</i> spend money on <i class="emphasize">small indulgences</i> during recessions, economic downturns, or when they personally have little cash. They do not have enough to spend on big-ticket luxury items; however, many still find the cash for purchases of small luxury items, such as premium lipstick. For this reason, companies that benefit from the lipstick effect tend to be resilient even during economic downturns.
