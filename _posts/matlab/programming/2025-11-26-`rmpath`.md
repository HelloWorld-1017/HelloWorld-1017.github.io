When I was writing blog[^2], I used a simple example to show how to add all functions (or classes) within a folder, including all subfolders, into the search path. After that, however, when I wanted to delete this folder, I found I couldn't --- I didn't have permission.

There are two methods to solve this problem:

1. Restart MATLAB and then delete, since MATLAB will automatically delete those temporary search paths after closing.
2. Use `rmpath` function[^1] to remove the newly added search path, `rmpath(genpath('folders'))`, and then I could delete it successfully.
