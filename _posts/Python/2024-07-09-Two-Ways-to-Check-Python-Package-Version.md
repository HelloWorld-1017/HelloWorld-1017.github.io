# `__version__` attribute

Python `__version__` attribute is used to “retrieving the version number from a third party package”[^1]. Take Python Matplotlib package.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.__version__
```

```
'3.9.1'
```

<br>

# `pip show` command

`pip show` is to “show information about a package” and `pip show --verbose` is to “show *all* information about a package”[^2], and these information include package version. Also take Matplotlib.

```powershell
pip show matplotlib
```

```
pip show matplotlib
Name: matplotlib
Version: 3.9.1
