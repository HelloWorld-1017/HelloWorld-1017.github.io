## The biggest mistake

<i class="emphasize">It’s not good to focus on individual words</i> and try and translate them, because <i class="emphasize">words change in context</i>.

We <i class="term">drop sounds</i> (vowels and consonants) when words come together.

- Good day -> Goo\_ day (drop the 'd')
- Excuse me! -> Scuse me! (drop the 'e')
- Shall we go? -> Shwe go? (drop the 'all')
- That's fine. -> sfine. (drop the 'that'. Even drop whole words.)

When we put words together, we also <i class="term">link sounds</i>.

- Have a -> hav\_a /Hævə/.

Sometimes when we link words, we <i class="term">add another sound</i>.

- Go and -> go_w_an (also drop the 'd').

A complicated example:

- Shall we go and have a good day? -> Shwe go\_w\_an hav\_a goo\_ day?

Besides, we (1) <i class="term">stress certain words</i>, (2) <i class="term">reduce some words</i>, (3) <i class="term">add intonation</i>, (4) <i class="term">add rhythm</i>, and (5) <i class="term">add tone</i>. So, <i class="emphasize">start to focus on the SOUNDS rather than INDIVIDUAL WORDS</i>.

## Five essentials for better listening

### Word stress

 Focus on the stressed words (that carry the main meaning): nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs.

- I'd <u>like</u> to get a <u>ticket</u> to <u>London</u>.
- Can you <u>pay</u> by <u>cash</u>?
-  You should've <u>asked</u>, I would've been <u>happ</u>y to <u>do</u> it.
- Ah, it's <u>fine</u>, I didn't want to <u>trouble</u> <u>you</u>.

<div class="notice--primary" markdown="1">

 **Two kinds of listening:**

- <i class="term">Intensive listening</i>: short clips you analyze
  - <i class="emphasize">Focus on stressed words</i>, underline them, listen for the main idea (the gist).
  - <i class="emphasize">Don't need to be focusing on every words.</i>
- <i class="term">Extensive listening</i>: longer clips to enjoy, like films and podcasts.

###  Focus on chunks

A <i class="term">CHUNK</i> is a piece of language where we focus on the sound, not the word.

<i class="emphasize">More grammatical forms are chunks</i>.

- I'd like to ...
- I should've ...
- I would've ...
- Can you ...
- I want to ...
- I didn<u>'t</u> want to ...
- I wante<u>d</u> to ...

<i class="emphasize">Many idiomatic expressions and phrases are chunks.</i>

- It's a piece of cake.
- It doesn't matter.
- Have a good day!

### Weak forms

<i class="emphasize">We say the <i class="term">strong form</i> when we stress these words</i>.

- Who is this FOR?
- Who do I give it TO?

 <i class="emphasize">Most of the time we don't stress and we use the <i class="term">weak form</i></i>.

- For: /fə/
- To: /tə/
- Do: /də/
- Are: /ə/
- You: /jə/

e.g.

- <u>Do</u> /də/ <u>you</u> /jə/ like pizza?
- a ticket <u>to</u> /tə/ London.
- a table <u>for</u> /fə/ two

Those words (small words) that have weak form.

- Auxiliaries
  - was /wəz/
  - were /wə/
  - do /də/
  - have /həv/
  - can /kən/, ...

- Personal pronouns
  - you /jə/
  - he /hi/
  - she /ʃə/, ...

- Prepositions
  - to /tə/
  - at /ət/
  - of /əf/
  - for /fə/, ...

- Conjunctions
  - and /ən/
  - but /bə/
  - than /ðə/, ...


By and large, <i class="emphasize">it's a <i class="term">schwa sound /ə/</i> that we're using in the weak form, not always, but usually</i>.

### Using contractions

In spoken English <i class="emphasize">we normally use <i class="term">contractions</i></i>.

- I will = I'll
- I am = I'm
- I would = I'd
  - I'd like to get a ticket to London.

- I should have = I should've
  - I should've called you before coming.

- I would have = I would've (or, I'd've)
  - You should've asked, I would've been happy to do it.

- It's fine = sfine.

### Connected speech

<i class="term">Connected speech</i> is the big one that makes listening really difficult but once you get this, your listening skills are gonna rock it. <i class="emphasize">When a word ends with a consonant sound and the next word begins with a vowel sound, we usually connect the two words.</i> We can connect the sounds or we can add a sound to make the connection.

- I’d like to ge<u>t a</u> ticke<u>t t</u>o London.
- I should've <u>called you</u> /kɔːldjə/ before coming. (/də/ -> /djə/)
- You should'<u>ve asked</u> /væsd/. (also drop the 'k')
- to do it /duːwit/.
- I didn't want to /didnwɒntə/ trouble you.
