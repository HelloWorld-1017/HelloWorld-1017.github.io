***Numerical analysis (second edition)* by Timothy Sauer.**

<div class="quote--left">The second edition owes a debt to many people, including the students of many classes who have read and commented on earlier versions. In addition, Paul Lorczak, Maurino Bautista, and Tom Wegleitner were essential in helping me avoid embarrassing blunders. Suggestions from Nicholas Allgaier, Regan Beckhan, Paul Calamai, Mark Friedman, David Hiebeler, Ashwani Kapila, Andrew Knyazev, Bo Li, Yijiang Li, Jeff Parker, Robert Sachs, Evelyn Sander, Gantumur Tsogtgerel, and Thomas Wanner were appreciated. The resourceful staff at Pearson, including William Hoffman, Caroline Celano, Beth Houston, Jeff Weidenaar, and Brandon Rawnsley, as well as Shiny Rajesh at Integra-PDY, mad the production of the second edition almost enjoyable.

My parents, who teach me.

Like all books, The Psychology of Money wouldn’t have been possible without the help of countless people who helped me along the way. There are too many to list them all. But a few who have been particularly supportive:

Brian Richards, who bet on me before anyone else.

Craig Shapiro, who bet on me when he didn’t have to.

Gretchen Housel, whose support is unwavering.

Jenna Abdou, who helps while asking for nothing in return.

Craig Pearce, who encourages, guides, and grounds me.

Jamie Catherwood, Josh Brown, Brent Beshore, Barry Ritholtz, Ben Carlson, Chris Hill, Michael Batnick, James Osorne, whose feedback is invaluable.

Thank you.
