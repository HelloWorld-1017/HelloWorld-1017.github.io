## Introduction: The Greatest Show On Earth

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

The promise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

... financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important that what you know.

I call this soft skill the psychology of money ...

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

Physics isn’t controversial. It’s guided by laws. Finance is different. It’s guided by people’s behaviors. And how I behave might make sense to me but look crazy to you.

I love Voltaire’s observation that “History never repeats itself; man always does.” It applies so well to how we behave with money.

## Chapter 1: No One’s Crazy

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

You know stuff about money that I don’t, and vice versa. You go through life with different beliefs, goals, and forecasts, than I do. That’s not because one of us is smarter than the other, or has better information. It’s because we’ve had different lives shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences.
