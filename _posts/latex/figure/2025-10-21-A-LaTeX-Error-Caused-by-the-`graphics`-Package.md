When writing blog[^1], I found an error caused by the LaTeX `graphics` package:

```
doc.tex: error: 10: Argument of \Gin@iii has an extra }. ...cludegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig1.jpg}}
```

and I imported the `graphicx` package instead to solve this problem. These two packages are sort of different, although both of them are to display figures, and `graphicx` is preferred[^2]:

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

`graphicx` is an extension of `graphics`. Moreover, while `graphics` sticks to the original TeX conventions concerning arguments, `graphicx` allows optional arguments according to the more transparent `key=value` scheme.
