By entering `import this`, we can get “The Zen of Python”[^1][^2] by Tim Peters:

```python
import this
```

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

If two Python programmers are asked to solve the same problem, they  should come up with fairly compatible solutions. This is not to say there’s no room for creativity in programming. On the contrary! But much of programming consists of using small, common approaches to simple situations  within a larger, more creative project. The nuts and bolts of your programs  should make sense to other Python programmers.[^3]

```
Now is better than never.
```

You could spend the rest of your life learning all the intricacies of Python  and of programming in general, but then you’d never complete any projects. Don’t try to write perfect code; write code that works, and then decide  whether to improve your code for that project or move on to something new.[^3]
