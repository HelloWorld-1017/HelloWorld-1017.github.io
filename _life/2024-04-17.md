<br>

Do you ever feel alone

Standing in the road

Don't know where to go

In the air my memories flow

Faces in a row

Take a long way home

But all of these remind me to believe

No one will stay or leave

And then all of these remind me to receive

Life we can see

La la la ~

The sun will rise and fall

La la la ~

It's just another day

<br>
