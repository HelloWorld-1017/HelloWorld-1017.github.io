**Observer-expectancy effect**[^1]

The **observer-expectancy effect** (AKA the **experimenter-expectancy effect**, **expectancy bias**, **observer effect**, or **experimenter effect**) is a form of reactivity in which a researcher's cognitive bias causes them to subconsciously influence the participants of an experiment. **Confirmation bias** can lead to the experimenter interpreting results incorrectly because of the tendency to look for information that conforms to their hypothesis, and overlook information that argues against it. It is a significant threat to a study's internal validity, and is therefore typically controlled using a **double-blind experimental design**. It may include conscious or unconscious influences on subject behavior including creation of demand characteristics that influence subjects, and altered or selective recording of experimental results themselves.

**Confirmation bias**[^2]

**Confirmation bias** (also **confirmatory bias**, **myside bias**, or **congeniality bias**) is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values. People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. The effect is strongest for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply entrenched beliefs. Confirmation bias is insuperable for most people, but they can manage it, for example, by education and training in critical thinking skills.

**Double-blind experimental design**[^3]

In medical research, the terms **single-blind**, **double-blind** and **triple-blind** are commonly used to describe blinding. These terms describe experiments in which (respectively) one, two, or three parties are blinded to some information. Most often, single-blind studies blind patients to their treatment allocation, double-blind studies blind both patients and researchers to treatment allocations, and triple-blinded studies blind patients, researcher, and some other third party (such as a monitoring committee) to treatment allocations. However, the meaning of these terms can vary from study to study.
