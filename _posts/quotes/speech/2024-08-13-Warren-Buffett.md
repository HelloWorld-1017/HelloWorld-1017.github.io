<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

I‚Äôve seen more people fail because of liquor and leverage -- leverage being borrowed money. You really don‚Äôt need leverage in this world much. If you‚Äôre smart, you‚Äôre going to make a lot of money without borrowing.

I often recommend low-cost S&P 500 index funds, but only a few humble friends would believe me. Hardly any of the extremely wealthy investors, fund managers, and pension funds actually followed my advice, and they politely thanked me. But the turnaround was persuaded by asset management managers who charged high management fees to choose another way of investing.[^3]

Q: My question is, if you had to pick one stock to bet on, and be resilient in the inflation, which would you choose? And what specifically enables that stock to do very well in what might very likely be a difficult market?

Warren Buffett: Well, I‚Äôll tell you something even better than that one stock. Maybe we‚Äôll get to one stock. But **the best thing you can do is to be exceptionally good at something**. If you‚Äôre the best doctor in town, if you‚Äôre the best lawyer in town, if you‚Äôre the best whatever it may be, no matter whether people are paying you with a zillion dollars or paying with, **they‚Äôre going to give you some of what they produce in exchange for what you deliver**. And, if you‚Äôre the one they pick out to do any particular activity, sing, or play baseball, or be their lawyer, whatever it may be, **whatever abilities you have can‚Äôt be taken away from you**, **they can‚Äôt actually be inflated away from you**. Somebody else will give you some of the wheat they produce, or the cotton, or whatever it may be, and they will trade you for the skill you have. So, **the best investment by far is anything that develops yourself**. And, again, **it‚Äôs not taxed**. So, that‚Äôs what I would do.

Charlie Munger: I got some advice for you, too. When you have your own retirement account, and your friendly advisor suggests you put all the money into bitcoin, just say no.

Warren Buffett: **Nobody can take away from you the talent you have.** And the truth is that the world will always be willing. They‚Äôll need to do something, and some people will not have skills, and they will get less of a product of the society than somebody who has other skills. **And sometimes that has something to do with education, but a good bit of the time it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with education.** But, just figure out what you‚Äôd like to be, and figure out how, and **what you‚Äôd like to be is what you‚Äôre going to likely to be good at**, and, you know, the world will always need somebody on that tube to tell us what‚Äôs going on. So, you know, study Becky Quick[^5] or somebody and, figure out, you know, what makes her good. And **what you sort of naturally bring to the game**. I mean, I could have, who‚Äôs the guy that says you‚Äôve got to spend 10,000 hours doing this or that, Malcolm Gladwell[^6]. Malcolm Gladwell, you know, would say, just spend 10,000 hours on something. Well, **I could have spent 10,000 hours trying to become a heavyweight boxer, but I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve felt very good at the end of the 10,000 hours**. And, you know, you stumble into what you really like doing, what you‚Äôre good at, and what is useful to society. And then it doesn‚Äôt make any difference what the dollar bill, you know, is now worth, in terms of the purchasing power, a cent, or a half-a-cent, or a hundredth of a cent. If you‚Äôre the best doctor in town, they‚Äôll bring you chickens, whatever they may do, but they can‚Äôt take it away from you. And my guess is that, if you‚Äôve come to five meetings, you know, you‚Äôve got a very good future ahead of you. I mean, that shows, it self-selects, I mean. So, if you want to sell a piece of yourself, you know, we‚Äôll buy that as the best investment we can make, we‚Äôll take 10% of your future earnings, and we‚Äôll give you a cash payment now. And, you know, we‚Äôll have a terrific asset. And you can have 100% of your future earnings. And if you develop your talent, maybe you‚Äôll be a great dancer, people pay money to watch great dancers. We had Fred Astaire and his sister, Adele, that came from Omaha, you know. Their name was Austerlitz then, but they could dance. And Adele did whatever she did with him, moved to England. And Fred Astaire went on to do a whole bunch of other things. And Ginger Rogers had to do it all the same, backwards, in high heels, and she didn‚Äôt get paid as much because she was a woman. But you‚Äôre going to do just fine. I‚Äôd bet a lot of money on you.[^7][^8]
