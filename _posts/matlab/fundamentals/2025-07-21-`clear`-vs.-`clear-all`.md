In MATLAB, the `clear` function is used to “remove items from workspace, freeing up system memory”[^1], and it accepts some following options, such as `clear all`.

The command `clear` is to “remove all variables from the current workspace, releasing them from system memory”[^1], that is, it can only clear <i class="emphasize">all variables</i> in the current workspace, whereas `clear all` can remove more items[^1]:

As can be seen, `clear all` seem not recommended as it will decrease the code performance and is usually unnecessary. Having said that, it is useful in some special cases, for example when we use the `inmem` function to test the dependencies of a function[^2] --- in this case, `clear all` creates a very clean workspace to help us obtain the minimal dependency information.
