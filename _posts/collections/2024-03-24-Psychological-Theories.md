## Broken windows theory

> [Broken windows theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory).
>
> - The theory was introduced in a 1982 article by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling. It was popularized in the 1990s by New York City police commissioner William Bratton and mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose policing policies were influenced by the theory.

In criminology, the <i class="term">broken windows theory</i> states that <i class="emphasize">visible signs of crime</i>, antisocial behavior and civil disorder create an urban environment that <i class="emphasize">encourages</i> further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes, such as vandalism, loitering, public drinking and fare evasion, help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness.

## Dunning窶適ruger effect (DK effect)

> [Dunning窶適ruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).
>
> - It was first described by Justin Kruger and David Dunning in 1999.
> - [With some knowledge comes great confidence (and negative attitudes toward science)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01678-7?utm_medium=organic_social&utm_source=wechat&utm_campaign=CONR_NAJRN_ATT1_AP_CNCM_002E6_nfh).

The <i class="term">Dunning窶適ruger effect</i> is a <i class="term">cognitive bias</i> in which people with limited competence in a particular domain <i class="emphasize">overestimate</i> their abilities. Some researchers also include the opposite effect for <i class="emphasize">high performers</i>: their <i class="emphasize">tendency</i> to underestimate their skills. In popular culture, the Dunning窶適ruger effect is often <i class="emphasize">misunderstood</i> as a claim about <i class="emphasize">general</i> overconfidence of people with <i class="emphasize">low intelligence</i> instead of <i class="emphasize">specific</i> overconfidence of people <i class="emphasize">unskilled</i> at a <i class="emphasize">particular task</i>.

## Illusory superiority

> [Illusory superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority).
>
> - The term "illusory superiority" was first used by the researchers Van Yperen and Buunk, in 1991.

In <i class="term">social psychology</i>, <i class="term">illusory superiority</i> is a <i class="term">cognitive bias</i> wherein people <i class="emphasize">overestimate</i> their own qualities and abilities compared to others. Illusory superiority is one of many <i class="term">positive illusions</i>, relating to the <i class="term">self</i>, that are evident in the study of intelligence, the effective performance of tasks and tests, and the possession of desirable personal characteristics and personality traits. Overestimation of abilities compared to an objective measure is known as the <i class="term">overconfidence effect</i>.

The phenomenon is also known as the <i class="term">above-average effect</i>, the <i class="term">superiority bias</i>, the <i class="term">leniency error</i>, the <i class="term">sense of relative superiority</i>, the <i class="term">primus inter pares effect</i>, and the <i class="term">Lake Wobegon effect</i>, named after the fictional town where all the children are above average. The <i class="term">Dunning-Kruger effect</i> is a form of illusory superiority shown by people on a task where their level of skill is low.

## Observer-expectancy effect

> [Observer-expectancy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect).

The <i class="term">observer-expectancy effect</i> (a.k.a. the <i class="term">experimenter-expectancy effect</i>, <i class="term">expectancy bias</i>, <i class="term">observer effect</i>, or <i class="term">experimenter effect</i>) is a form of reactivity in which a researcher's <i class="term">cognitive bias</i> causes them to <i class="emphasize">subconsciously</i> influence the participants of an experiment. Confirmation bias can lead to the experimenter interpreting results incorrectly because of the <i class="emphasize">tendency</i> to <i class="emphasize">look for</i> information <i class="emphasize">that conforms to their hypothesis</i>, and <i class="emphasize">overlook</i> information that argues <i class="emphasize">against</i> it. It is a significant threat to a study's internal validity, and is therefore typically controlled using a <i class="term">double-blind experimental design</i>. It may include conscious or unconscious influences on subject behavior including creation of demand characteristics that influence subjects, and altered or selective recording of experimental results themselves.

<br>

[Confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias): <i class="term">Confirmation bias</i> (also <i class="term">confirmatory bias</i>, <i class="term">myside bias</i>, or <i class="term">congeniality bias</i>) is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and <i class="emphasize">recall</i> information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values. People display this bias when they <i class="emphasize">select information</i> that supports their views, <i class="emphasize">ignoring contrary information</i>, or when they interpret <i class="emphasize">ambiguous evidence</i> as supporting their existing attitudes. The effect is strongest for <i class="emphasize">desired outcomes</i>, for <i class="emphasize">emotionally charged issues</i>, and for <i class="emphasize">deeply entrenched beliefs</i>. Confirmation bias is <i class="emphasize">insuperable</i> for most people, but they can manage it, for example, by <i class="emphasize">education and training in critical thinking skills</i>.

<br>

[Double-blind experimental design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment#Terminology): In medical research, the terms <i class="term">single-blind</i>, <i class="term">double-blind</i> and <i class="term">triple-blind</i> are commonly used to describe <i class="term">blinding</i>. These terms describe experiments in which (respectively) one, two, or three <i class="emphasize">parties</i> are <i class="emphasize">blinded to some information</i>. Most often, single-blind studies blind patients to their treatment allocation, double-blind studies blind both patients and researchers to treatment allocations, and triple-blinded studies blind patients, researcher, and <i class="emphasize">some other third party</i> (such as a <i class="emphasize">monitoring committee</i>) to treatment allocations. However, the meaning of these terms can vary from study to study.

Related theory in sociology, [self-fulfilling prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy): A <i class="term">self-fulfilling prophecy</i> is a prediction that comes true at least in part as a result of a person's <i class="emphasize">belief</i> or <i class="emphasize">expectation</i> that the prediction would come true. In the phenomena, <i class="emphasize">people tend to act the way they have been expected to in order to make the expectations come true</i>. Self-fulfilling prophecies are an example of the more general phenomenon of <i class="term">positive feedback loops</i>. A self-fulfilling prophecy <i class="emphasize">can have either negative or positive outcomes</i>. Merely <i class="emphasize">applying a label</i> to someone or something can <i class="emphasize">affect</i> the perception of the person/thing and <i class="emphasize">create</i> a self-fulfilling prophecy. <i class="emphasize">Interpersonal communication</i> plays a significant role in establishing these phenomena as well as impacting the labeling process.

## Slippery slope

> - [Slippery slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope).
> - [Slippery Slope](https://www.txst.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/slippery-slope.html).

In a <i class="term">slippery slope argument</i>, a course of action is rejected because the slippery slope advocate believes it will lead to a chain reaction resulting in an <i class="emphasize">undesirable</i> end or ends. The core of the slippery slope argument is that a specific decision under debate is likely to result in <i class="emphasize">unintended</i> consequences. The strength of such an argument depends on whether the small step really is likely to lead to the effect. This is quantified in terms of what is known as the warrant (in this case, a demonstration of the process that leads to the significant effect).

## Survivorship bias

> [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).

<i class="term">Survivorship bias</i> or <i class="term">survival bias</i> is the <i class="term">logical error</i> of <i class="emphasize">concentrating</i> on entities that <i class="emphasize">passed a selection process</i> while <i class="emphasize">overlooking</i> those that <i class="emphasize">did not</i>. This can lead to <i class="emphasize">incorrect conclusions</i> because of <i class="emphasize">incomplete data</i>.

Survivorship bias is a form of <i class="term">selection bias</i> that can lead to <i class="emphasize">overly optimistic beliefs</i> because multiple failures are overlooked, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the <i class="emphasize">successes in a group have some special property</i>, rather than just coincidence as in <i class="emphasize">correlation "proves" causality</i>.

Another kind of survivorship bias would involve thinking that an incident happened in a particular way because the only people who were <i class="emphasize">involved</i> in the incident who can <i class="emphasize">speak about</i> it are those who <i class="emphasize">survived</i> it. Even if one knew that some people are dead, they would not have their voice to add to the conversation, making it biased.
