# README

This repo is supporting my personal blog website: [WHAT A STARRY NIGHT~](https://helloworld-1017.github.io/). The website is based on Jekyll theme [mmistakes/minimal-mistakes - GitHub](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by Michael Rose *et al.*

To my mind, writing things down is to forget it and carry on. If lucky, I hope these dots could be connected one day when I looking backward.

The `.md` source files of posted blogs can be found in [_posts](https://github.com/Ma1017/Ma1017.github.io/tree/main/_posts) folder, and to increase the website deployment speed, the attachments of posted blogs were moved to another public repository [HelloWorld-1017/HelloWorld-1017.github.io-post-attachments: Post attachments of my personal website](https://github.com/HelloWorld-1017/HelloWorld-1017.github.io-post-attachments).

You are welcome to email me at [maqinghua1017@gmail.com](maqinghua1017@gmail.com) if have any question.
