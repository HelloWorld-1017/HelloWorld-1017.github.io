The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail---its roof may shake---the wind may blow through it---the storm may enter---the rain may enter---but the King of England cannot enter!

speech, March 1763, in Lord Brougham *Historical Sketches of Statesmen in the Time of George III* First Series (1845) vol. 1.
