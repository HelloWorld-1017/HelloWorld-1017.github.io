God made solids, but surfaces were the work of the devil.[^1]

Once I heard a Professor quoted this Wolfgang Pauliâ€™s saying in a lesson. This words impressed me so much that when I see any research about materials after that, it always come to my mind immediately. Unfortunately, benefits brought by elaborated-designed material structures sometimes are unimportant (and even counterproductive) if considering area effect and volume effect.
