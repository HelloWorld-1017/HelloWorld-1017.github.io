In 2022, I bought an HHKB keyboard, i.e. HHKB Professional Hybrid Type-S (white color; blank keycaps)[^1], showing below:

<div class="notice--primary" markdown="1">

Those pink key caps are that I replaced üòÑ 

I bought the blank version; the keyboard layout can refer to the stamped version[^1]:

As the introduction in product advertisement[^1]:

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

The top of the line HHKB Professional HYBRID Type-S might be the last keyboard you ever want to own. Its exclusive Type-S Topre silent switches dramatically reduce keystroke noise, while its ergonomic design lets you type for hours on end without feeling fatigued. You can easily create your own keymaps for a completely personalized user experience, and connect up to 4 Bluetooth devices and swap between them instantly.

</div>

I don‚Äôt know if it is ‚Äòthe last keyboard I ever want to own‚Äô, but I indeed really like it. And I‚Äôm in favor of that a great keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è can make typing comfortable and even ‚Äòaddictive‚Äô, 

This product supports two connection modes: USB Type-C (wired) and Bluetooth (wireless). At the beginning, I like Bluetooth mode, and actually for this reason I bought it. But later on, I remember that there was something inconvenient when using Bluetooth, so I turned to connect by USB Type-C cable, which makes me feel solid in a way. 

But recently, I found if I use USB Type-C to connect it with a new PC, the light at the top-right corner keeps on (in blue), but the keyboard has no response to my typing. I remember that I ever met and then solved this problem, but I forget how to do it. To not forget it again, I‚Äôll take a note in this post. In fact, the logic is very simple.

<br>

As was described, my keyboard has two connection modes. When I connect it to a new PC, it will automatically get into Bluetooth mode (rather than wired mode) and wait for connection[^2] --- lit-up LED indicate this point --- although I didn‚Äôt put AA batteries[^3]:

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

During the connection process, the LED indicator light corresponding to the pressed number key lights up in blue. It will turn off after the connection is established.

</div>

By the way, this keyboard can store four Bluetooth paring information, and users can press `[Fn]` + `[Control]` + `[1]` to `[4]` keys to switch to different registered devices.
{: .notice--primary}

Specifically, at this moment, it is in Bluetooth mode, and LED is lit up meaning that it is still waiting for connection. Which is why there is no response when I press the keys, despite that I connect the keyboard with PC via USB cable[^2]:

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

The keyboard will not switch to the USB connection simply by connecting the USB cable.

</div>

So, to make it available, I should switch to USB connection mode, by the way of pressing `[Fn]` + `[Control]` + `[0]` keys. After connection, the light will turn off, meaning that the connection is established[^4], hence the keyboard available.

During the process of searching for information, I found a website by chance, [https://happyhackingkb.com/](https://happyhackingkb.com/) [^5], and in which I got a very interesting expression from Eiiti Wada[^6] might explaining why so many people, myself included, are more obsessed with keyboards than computers:

<div class="notice" markdown="1">

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

Cowboys in the western United States leave their horses when they die. But never leave their saddles, regardless of how long they need to walk in the desert. Saddles are interfaces that are deeply adapted to our bodies whereas horses are consumable items. It should not be forgotten that computers are consumables nowadays, but keyboards are interfaces that we can use through our lives.

I can get this kind of feeling. Definitely right. And this is a more persuasive reason for me to write this blog. As in the post title, I want to re-know my ‚Äòsaddle‚Äô from now on. ü§†
