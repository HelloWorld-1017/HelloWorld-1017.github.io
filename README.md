# README

This public repository is supporting my personal website: [WHAT A STARRY NIGHT~](https://helloworld-1017.github.io/), based on Jekyll theme [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by Michael Rose *et al.*

The `.md` source files of posted blogs can be found in [_posts](https://github.com/HelloWorld-1017/HelloWorld-1017.github.io/tree/main/_posts) folder, and their attachments are put in another public repository [HelloWorld-1017/HelloWorld-1017.github.io-post-attachments: Post attachments of my personal website](https://github.com/HelloWorld-1017/HelloWorld-1017.github.io-post-attachments).

To my mind, writing something down is to forget it in a way and carry on. That said, I hope I can connect these dots looking backward.
