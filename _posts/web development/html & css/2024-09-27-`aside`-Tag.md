HTML `aside` tag[^1]:

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

The `<aside>` tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.

The aside content should be <i class="emphasize">indirectly</i> related to the surrounding content.

**Tip:** The `<aside>` content is often placed as a <i class="emphasize">sidebar</i> in a document.

**Note:** The `<aside>` element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the `<aside> `element (see example below).

</div>

Reference[^1] provides two examples.

Example 1:

```html
<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>

<aside>
<h4>Epcot Center</h4>
<p>Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p>
</aside>
```
