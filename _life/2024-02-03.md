**丑奴儿·书博山道中壁**

（宋）辛弃疾

少年不知愁滋味，爱上层楼。爱上层楼，为赋新词强说愁。

而今识尽愁滋味，欲说还休。欲说还休，却道天凉好个秋。

<br>

**2024年2月3日**

时隔很多年，昨天又去了龙门石窟。虽然已经是深冬，下着中雪，并非“好个秋”，但是心里一直在想着这阕词。现在自己这个年纪倒没有资格感慨“识尽愁滋味”，但也多少懂得了一些“欲说还休”的无奈。完全是无奈吗？应该还有几分豁达吧。

前两天在YouTube上看到了国立台湾大学中国文学系教授欧丽娟的演讲，“孤独的多棱镜”[^1]。

在演讲中，欧教授讲到了这阙词的后半阙，并且认为Albert Camus所撰写的《瘟疫》中的一段话是”欲说还休“的绝佳注脚：

Moreover, in this extremity of solitude none could count on any help from his neighbor; each had to bear the load of his troubles alone. **If, by some chance, one of us tried to unburden himself or to say something about his feelings, the reply he got, whatever it might be, usually wounded him.** And then it dawned on him that he and the man with him weren't talking about the same thing. **For while he himself spoke from the depths of long days of brooding upon his personal distress, and the image he had tried to impart had been slowly shaped and proved in the fires of passion and regret, this meant nothing to the man to whom he was speaking, who pictured a conventional emotion, a grief that is traded on the market-place, mass-produced.** Whether friendly or hostile, the reply always missed fire, and the attempt to communicate had to be given up. This was true of those at least for whom silence was unbearable, and since the others could not find the truly expressive word, they resigned themselves to using the current coin of language, the commonplaces of plain narrative, of anecdote, and of their daily paper. So in these cases, too, even the sincerest grief had to make do with the set phrases of ordinary conversation. Only on these terms could the prisoners of the plague ensure the sympathy of their concierge and the interest of their hearers.

—The Plague, Albert Camus[^2].

欧丽娟教授认为，当人“识**尽**愁滋味”后，尤其是经历着瘟疫这种直面死亡的苦难和折磨的时候，是想要做些什么、说些什么来缓解自己的哪怕一点点的痛苦（... tried to unburden himself or to say something about his feelings）。因此，语言的苍白和无力并不是最终选择沉默的原因，而是一旦说出来，通常受到伤害。并没有真正的感同身受。

但是，辛弃疾作为一个豪放派词人的代表人物，“欲说还休”后面紧跟着的”却道天凉好个秋“真的没有一点豁达吗？我更愿意相信这是一个相当潇洒的留白吧。
