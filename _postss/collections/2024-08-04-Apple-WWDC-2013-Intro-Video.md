<br>

if everyone

is busy making everything

how can anyone perfect anything?

we start to confuse convenience

with joy

abundance with choice.

designing something requires

focus

the first thing we ask is

what do we want people to feel?

delight

surprise

love

connection

then we begin to craft around our intention

it takes time.

there are a thousand noâ€™s

for every yes.

we simplify

we perfect

we start over

until every thing we touch

enhances each life

it touches.

only then do we sign our work.
