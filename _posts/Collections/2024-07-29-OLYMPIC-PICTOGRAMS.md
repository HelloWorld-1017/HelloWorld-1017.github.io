Paris 2024 has reinvented the concept of Olympic and Paralympic pictograms, elevating them from mere visual aids to striking coats of arms that serve as rallying cries for sports fans.

The 62 pictograms of the Olympic and Paralympic Games are standards that symbolise not only the different sports, but also pride, values, and a large and diverse family. They will bedeck the competition venues and appear everywhere that the Games are taking place to guide spectators and drive crowds to the right areas.

The idea is to share these coats of arms with as many people as possible, including athletes, federation members, supporters…and you! Pick a coat of arms and wear it with pride!

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

... Each Paris 2024 pictograms is composed of three graphical elements: **an axis of symmetry**, a depiction of the ground and a representation of the sport that it illustrates. Of course, being French, it is full of style and elegance! Art and sport are merged into one.
