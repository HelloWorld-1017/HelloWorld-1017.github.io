**Active "Presenter View"**

In Microsoft PowerPoint, we can use the presenter view. If we have two computer monitors, we just need to check `Use Presenter View` in the `Slide Show` panel[^1]; if we just have one monitor, we could firstly show slide, and then right click the mouse and choose `Show Presenter View` option (and then use `Hide Presenter View` to deactivate).

<br>

**Active "Rehearse Timings"**

Check `Rehearse Timings` in the `Slide Show` panel[^2].
