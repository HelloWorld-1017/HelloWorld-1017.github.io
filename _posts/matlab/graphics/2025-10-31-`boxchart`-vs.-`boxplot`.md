# A warning of using `boxplot` on `tiledlayout`

Days ago, when I used `boxplot` function[^1] in the tile generated by `tiledlayout` function[^2], a warning occurred:

```
Warning: boxplot might not be displayed properly in the tiled chart layout. 
> In boxplot>renderLabels/setLabelappdata (line 3039)
In boxplot>renderLabels (line 2942)
In boxplot (line 428)
In pes16_plotScalabilityinTwoFig (line 54) 
```

It didn't actually affect the figure, at least for my case, but this operation indeed crops the box plot sometimes[^3]. And I think the accepted answer in[^3] analyzes this warning well:

<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

The `boxplot` function uses a local function `setLabelappdata()` to adjust the axes' `OuterPosition`, `PositionConstraint` & `LooseInset` properties after the boxplots are rendered.  However, these properties are not editable in axes created by TiledLayout.  Matlab throws a warning.  Hopefully MathWorks will either address this problem or make the position properties of tiledChartLayout objects editable.

```
Warning: Unable to set 'Position', 'InnerPosition', 'OuterPosition', or 
'ActivePositionProperty' for objects in a TiledChartLayout 
```

</div>

This is reasonable, because I encountered the above warning several times when I tried to adjust one axes' position on the tiled layout.

Right now, we can reproduce the `boxplot`-`tiledlayout` warning like this:

then we'll see two warnings:

```
Warning: boxplot might not be displayed properly in the tiled chart layout. 
> In boxplot>renderLabels/setLabelappdata (line 3039)
In boxplot>renderLabels (line 2942)
In boxplot (line 428)
In script5 (line 9) 
Warning: boxplot might not be displayed properly in the tiled chart layout. 
> In boxplot>renderLabels/setLabelappdata (line 3039)
In boxplot>renderLabels (line 2942)
In boxplot (line 428)
In script5 (line 15) 
```

Then, one idea just occurred to me: before I frequently use `tiledlayout` to organize subplots, I used `subplot` function[^4] a lot[^7], so I test if `boxplot` works well with `subplot`:

```matlab
clc, clear, close all

load carsmall

figure('Color', 'w')

subplot(1,2,1)
boxplot(MPG,Origin)
title('Miles per Gallon by Vehicle Origin')
xlabel('Country of Origin')
ylabel('Miles per Gallon (MPG)')

subplot(1,2,2)
boxplot(MPG,Origin)
title('Miles per Gallon by Vehicle Origin')
xlabel('Country of Origin')
ylabel('Miles per Gallon (MPG)')

exportgraphics(gcf, 'fig2.jpg', 'Resolution', 600)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelloWorld-1017/blog-images-1/main/imgs/20251101144716768.jpg" alt="fig2" style="width:50%;" />

At this point, the warning disappear! So, I guess this is a compatibility issue.

Then, I looked up some information online, and I found actually there is another function `boxchart`[^5] to realize a very similar effect as `boxplot`, so I just wanted to try if `boxchart` is compatible with `tiledlayout`:

```matlab
clc, clear, close all

load carsmall

figure('Color', 'w')
tiledlayout(1, 2)

% class(Origin) % 'char'
Origin = categorical(cellstr(Origin)); % Note well here
% class(Origin) % 'categorical'

nexttile
boxchart(Origin, MPG) % Note well here
title('Miles per Gallon by Vehicle Origin')
xlabel('Country of Origin')
ylabel('Miles per Gallon (MPG)')

nexttile
boxchart(Origin, MPG) % Note well here
title('Miles per Gallon by Vehicle Origin')
xlabel('Country of Origin')
ylabel('Miles per Gallon (MPG)')

exportgraphics(gcf, 'fig3.jpg', 'Resolution', 600)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelloWorld-1017/blog-images-1/main/imgs/20251101145637442.jpg" alt="fig3" style="width:50%;" />

At this time, the warning didn't appear! (NOTE: the use of `boxplot` and `boxchart` is sort of different. First, as can be seen from the code, we need to convert the `char` array to a `categorical` array; second, for `boxplot`, first data `MPG` then group name `Origin`, whereas for `boxchart` adopts the reversed order.)

So, it must be a compatibility issue. To verify this point, I checked the "Version History" part of these four functions' documentation, and found:

- `boxplot`[^1]: "Introduced before R2006a"
- `subplot`[^4]: "Introduced before R2006a"
- `boxchart`[^5]: "Introduced in R2020a"
- `tiledlayout`[^2]: "R2019b: Recommended over subplot: `tiledlayout` creates layouts that are more customizable and configurable than the layouts created by `subplot`. For example, you can create layouts with adjustable tile spacing, tiles that reflow according to the size of the figure, and better placed colorbars and legends."

So, I guess, `boxplot` and `subplot` belong to the old graphics system, whereas `boxchart` and `tiledlayout` belong to the new one --- maybe based on very different internal graphic classes and functions. Make sense anyway.

# `boxchart` vs. `boxplot`

So, both `boxchart` and `boxplot` are used to generate a box plot, but as can be seen from above examples (or look through those examples on the documentation), we can find, `boxplot`'s results are "old-fashioned" and `boxchart`'s look more modern. Because in the past I always use `boxplot` and this is my first time to know `boxchart`[^5], so I select two examples from the `boxchart` documentation to learn, shown as follows.

**(1) Update Color of `BoxChart` Object**

```matlab
clc, clear, close all

load patients
Gender = categorical(Gender);
Smoker = categorical(Smoker,logical([1 0]),{'Smoker','Nonsmoker'});

cgroupdata = Gender.*Smoker;
b = boxchart(Diastolic,'GroupByColor',cgroupdata);

legend('Location','southeast')

% Update the color of the third box chart by using the SeriesIndex property.
b(3).SeriesIndex = 6;

exportgraphics(gcf, 'fig4.jpg', 'Resolution', 600)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelloWorld-1017/blog-images-1/main/imgs/20251101152319134.jpg" alt="fig4" style="width:50%;" />

I think the reason why `boxchart` looks more modern, compared with `boxplot`, is that it can always fill the box body using color and adopt beautiful color matching to distinguish body and border, but old-fashioned `boxplot` doesn't (maybe hence save money when printing papers in the past).

**(2) Visualize and Find Outliers**

```matlab
clc, clear, close all

outages = readtable('outages.csv');

b = boxchart(outages.Customers);
ylabel('Number of Customers')

b.JitterOutliers = 'on';
b.MarkerStyle = '.';

exportgraphics(gcf, 'fig5.jpg', 'Resolution', 600)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HelloWorld-1017/blog-images-1/main/imgs/20251101153015180.jpg" alt="fig5" style="width:50%;" />

This example shows how to use the property `JitterOutliers` of `BoxChart` to create jittered outliers to realize a better visualization. It instantly reminds me of another Python example, "Palmer Penguins exploration with violinplots in Matplotlib"[^6], which adds some jitters, from a t-distribution, on the x-position of all data points to avoid them totally overlapped. However, the MATLAB `boxchart` function seems not support adding jitters for all points (only for those outliers, cause by default it only displays outliers).
