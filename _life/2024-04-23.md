On my way to dinner just now, I suddenly thought of Warren Buffett's rules for investments, which are famous and simple, saying:

<p style="text-align:center;"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=5>"The first rule of an investment is don't lose. And the second rule of an investment is don't forget the first rule. And that's all the rules there are."</font></p>

These quotes or suggestions just sound easy, "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication", right? As General Electric's former CEO Jeff Immelt said:

<p style="text-align:center;"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size=5>"Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it."</font></p>

Interesting anyway. Feel them in the life.
