<div class="quote--left" markdown="1">

We pass through the present with our eyes blindfolded. We are permitted merely to sense and guess at what we are actually experiencing. Only later when the cloth is untied can we glance at the past and find out what we have experienced and what meaning it has.

--- Milan Kundera (1929-2023), Laughable Loves.
