# What is the subjunctive mood?

English has four moods[^2]

1. **indicative**, for stating facts and opinions; 
2. **imperative**, for delivering orders, requests, or advice; 
3. **interrogative**, for asking questions; 
4. **subjunctive**, for wishes, unreal conditions, recommendations, doubts, and hypotheticals. 

We use the subjunctive mood to express **wishes** and **imagined situations** and to make **proposals** and **suggestions**.[^1]

**The Subjunctive Mood:** Subjunctive mood is a grammar tool that helps express an idea or state of being that is *hypothetical, proposed, supposed, requested, demanded, wished for*, or otherwise *contrary to fact*. Lawyers can skillfully use the subjunctive mood to discuss potential scenarios, assess consequences, and convey conditions that rely on uncertain outcomes.[^2]

**wish**

- I wish he were here.

**if only**

- If only I were taller.

<div class="notice--primary" markdown="1">

**if only**[^3]

We use “if only” to express a strong wish that things could be different. *It means the same as “I wish” but is stronger.* We use it to talk about past, present and future unreal conditions.

**“if only + past verb”**: to talk about a wish for the present.

- If only he knew the truth. (he doesn’t know the truth, but he wishes he did)
- If only there was something she could do or say to help.
- We sometimes use “were” instead of “was” in more formal situations:
  - If only she weren’t so tired. (If only she wasn’t so tired.)

**“if only + would + infinitive” without “to”**: to talk about a wish for the future or to show a contrast between how things are and how we would like them to be.

- If only someone would buy the house.
- If only they would talk to each other.

**“ if only + past perfect”**: to talk about a wish to change something that has already happened.

- If only he had listened to what his friends had been telling him. (He didn’t listen.)
- If only Anna had been able to come. (Anna wasn’t able to come.)

</div>

**would rather**

<div class="notice--primary" markdown="1">

If you say that you “would rather” do something or “you'd rather” do it, you mean that you would prefer to do it. If you say that “you would rather not” do something, you mean that you do not want to do it.[^10]

</div>

- I would rather he played outside more often instead of always sitting on the computer.
- If it's all the same to you, I'd rather work at home.

# Subjunctive verb forms

## Present subjunctive

The **present subjunctive** uses the **base form** of the verb with all subjects. 

We use the present subjective to talk about a **present** or **future** hypothetical.

- I suggested he <u>stop</u> eating out so often if he wants to save money.
- I suggested they <u>stop</u> eating out so often if they want to save money.

<br>

## Past subjunctive

In the **past subjunctive**, we use the **past simple form**, or **be**, we use **were** with all subjects.

We use the past subjunctive to talk about things **we wish were true** or that **we wish had happened in the past**.

- I wish she <u>were</u> here.

We often use the **past subjunctive** in subordinate clauses that begin with **as though** (**as if**)[^4], and **if**, as well as with the verb **wish**.

- He looked straight through me as if I <u>were</u> invisible.
- Dylan seemed so confident as though he <u>knew</u> he would win from the very beginning.
