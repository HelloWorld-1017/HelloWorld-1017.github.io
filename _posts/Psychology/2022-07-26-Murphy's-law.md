# Murphy’s law

**Murphy's law** [^1] is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong." In some formulations, it is extended to "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and at the worst possible time."

<br>

从数理统计的角度看[^2]，假设某意外事件在一次实验（活动）中发生的概率 $p$（$p>0$），则在 $n$ 次实验（活动）中至少有一次发生的概率 $P$ 为

$$
P=1-(1-p)^n\notag
$$

当 $n\rightarrow\infty$ 时，$P=1$。

# Murphy’s law in Nolan’s Interstellar

Murphy: Why did you and Mom name me after something that’s bad?

Cooper: We didn’t ... Murphy’s Law doesn’t mean that something bad will happen. What it means is whatever can happen will happen. And that sounded just fine with us. [^3][^4]
