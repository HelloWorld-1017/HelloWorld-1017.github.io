The Euler's formula[^1] is usually considered as the most beautiful equation in mathematics, mostly expressed as:

$$
\mathrm{e}^{\pi i}+1=0\notag
$$

The visual simplicity is one reason why it is viewed as *the most* beautiful. What’s more important is that it makes people who ever learned mathematics, more or less, feel amazing, because it perfectly combines together two most commonly used irrational numbers $\pi$ and $e$, imaginary unit $i$, the most fundamental integer “1”, and “0” which means nothing.

So, when today I happened to see that the Euler's formula is written in this form:

$$
\mathrm{e}^{\pi i}=-1\notag
$$

I felt it sort of odd, and lack aesthetic compared to the above form. Interesting. For the same mathematical notion, different degrees of regularity can be felt from different perspectives. Finding a good viewpoint at times helps to prove and understand mathematics.

That being said, there’s no a unified standard for beauty. Ramanujan’s formula to calculate $\pi$[^2]:

$$
\dfrac1\pi=\dfrac{2\sqrt2}{99^2}\sum_{k=0}^\infty\dfrac{(4k)!}{k!^4}\dfrac{26390k+1103}{396^{4k}}\notag
$$

is another kind, which, to my mind, is a beauty conveyed by carefully arranged complexity.
