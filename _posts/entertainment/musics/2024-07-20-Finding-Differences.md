Lyrics in English version[^1]:

<div class="quote--lyrics" markdown="1"><br>

Hey boy


Show me your love

You & I

<br>

Good morning

Hello, good morning

My day shines brightly like your smile

After I met you

Everything changed

My life used to be like a monsoon

But now there is a rainbow

I like you for matching my slow footsteps

I like how you shorten the distance between us

You & I, weâ€™re so alike

Even your clear smile, everything

<br>

You & I, letâ€™s start

Thereâ€™s not enough time for me to love

Please hurry a little

Weâ€™re so alike

So itâ€™s actually harder

Itâ€™s not easy

<br>

Love u love u love u

Love u love u love u

Love u love u love u

<br>

Hey baby I wanna

be your light light

When I see you, I get so excited, I sing

Youâ€™re so cynical but youâ€™re hot

Iâ€™ve fallen for your cool charms

Maybe my heart is fluttering too much

But I hope you feel the same way

I wanna spend every moment with you

I donâ€™t like ambiguous relationships

Give me assurance of love

I wanna be next to you

Letâ€™s play hide-and-go-seek

Wherever you are, I can find you

Itâ€™s because I like you

Sorry if thatâ€™s too much

But I canâ€™t hold it in

<br>

You & I, letâ€™s start

Thereâ€™s not enough time for me to love

Please hurry a little

Weâ€™re so alike

So itâ€™s actually harder

Itâ€™s not easy

<br>

Words I wanna say

Words I wanna hear

<br>

I hope you think the same way

Donâ€™t hide it, tell me boy

<br>

Words I couldnâ€™t say by myself

(Words I couldnâ€™t say by myself)

I love you

<br>

I Love u I love u

Come closer, hold my hand

I only have you

I wish time would stop

I wanna see you a little more

<br>

Love u love u love u

Love u love u love u

Love u love u love u

</div>
