# Introduction

Strictly speaking, there is no notion of 1D array in MATLAB programming: although row vector and column vector look like 1D arrays, in fact they are viewed as 2D arrays, just like a vector can be regarded as a special 2D matrix from the perspective of mathematics. As for why MATLAB designed like this, I think it’s probably determined by its product positioning, that is providing convenience for mathematical computations, and hence defining 1D array is not necessary. 

As for other programming languages, some of them choose to differentiate 1D and 2D array, such as Python and C. Array is a common data structure, and although it usually be seen as the counterpart of vector in mathematics, but array is more ‘practical’: its implementation involves operations on computer memory. Therefore, although I don’t get into the specific array construction mechanism, I guess that 1D array has its special advantages (may from the both perspectives of computation time and storage space) compared with 2D row vector and column vector.

So, it's better to treat array (a data structure in programming) and vector (in mathematics) as two standalone notions, accepting that a 1D array is just a sequence of numbers, neither a row nor a column vector[^1]. However, due to that I was used to MATLAB programming syntax before, I'm still not that familiar with 1D array and its difference between row vector and column vector when I turn to Python. Therefore, I’ll take some notes about them in this post by taking NumPy array and PyTorch tensor as examples.

# Define 1D array, column and row vector, and transpose them

## NumPy array

Take Python NumPy package. Methods to create 1D array and column and row vector (2D array) show as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

# 1D array
a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
print('# 1D array')
print(a, a.shape, '\n')

# Row vector (2D array)
b = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])
print('# Row vector (2D array)')
print(b, b.shape, '\n')

# Column vector (2D array)
c = np.array([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
print('# Column vector (2D array)')
print(c, c.shape, '\n')
```

```
# 1D array
[1. 2. 3.] (3,) 

# Row vector (2D array)
[[1. 2. 3.]] (1, 3) 

# Column vector (2D array)
[[1.]
 [2.]
 [3.]] (3, 1)
```

It should be noted that the shape of 1D array is `(3,)`, which looks very different from row and column vector.

For 1D array, its transpose is itself; for row vector (2D array), its transpose is column vector, and vice versa. By the way, there are two ways to make transpose.

```python
# For 1D array
aT1 = a.transpose()
aT2 = a.T
print('# For 1D array')
print(aT1, aT1.shape)
print(aT2, aT2.shape, '\n')

# For row vector (2D array)
bT1 = b.transpose()
bT2 = b.T
print('# For row vector (2D array)')
print(bT1, bT1.shape)
print(bT2, bT2.shape, '\n')

# For column vector (2D array)
cT1 = c.transpose()
cT2 = c.T
print('# For column vector (2D array)')
print(cT1, cT1.shape)
print(cT2, cT2.shape, '\n')
```

```
# For 1D array
[1. 2. 3.] (3,)
[1. 2. 3.] (3,) 

# For row vector (2D array)
[[1.]
 [2.]
 [3.]] (3, 1)
[[1.]
 [2.]
 [3.]] (3, 1) 

# For column vector (2D array)
[[1. 2. 3.]] (1, 3)
[[1. 2. 3.]] (1, 3) 
```

## PyTorch tensor

For PyTorch tensor, the situation is basically the same:

```python
import torch

# 1D tensor
a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
print('# 1D tensor')
print(a, a.shape, '\n')

# Row vector (2D tensor)
b = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])
print('# Row vector (2D tensor)')
print(b, b.shape, '\n')

# Column vector (2D tensor)
c = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
print('# Column vector (2D tensor)')
print(c, c.shape, '\n')
```

```
# 1D tensor
tensor([1., 2., 3.]) torch.Size([3]) 

# Row vector (2D tensor)
tensor([[1., 2., 3.]]) torch.Size([1, 3]) 

# Column vector (2D tensor)
tensor([[1.],
        [2.],
        [3.]]) torch.Size([3, 1]) 
```

Similarly, row vector and column vector, i.e. 2D tensor, are transposes of each other:

```python
# For row vector (2D tensor)
bT1 = b.transpose(1,0)
bT2 = b.T
print('# For row vector (2D tensor)')
print(bT1, bT1.shape)
print(bT2, bT2.shape, '\n')

# For column vector (2D tensor)
cT1 = c.transpose(1,0)
cT2 = c.T
print('# For column vector (2D tensor)')
print(cT1, cT1.shape)
print(cT2, cT2.shape, '\n')
```

```
# For row vector (2D tensor)
tensor([[1.],
        [2.],
        [3.]]) torch.Size([3, 1])
tensor([[1.],
        [2.],
        [3.]]) torch.Size([3, 1]) 

# For column vector (2D tensor)
tensor([[1., 2., 3.]]) torch.Size([1, 3])
tensor([[1., 2., 3.]]) torch.Size([1, 3]) 
```

but 1D tensor doesn’t support transpose operation:

```python
# For 1D array
aT1 = a.T
aT2 = a.transpose()
print('# For 1D tensor')
print(aT1, aT1.shape)
print(aT2, aT2.shape, '\n')
```

```

# Convert a 1D array into a 2D array (row vector or column vector)

## NumPy array

(1) By `np.newaxis`[^2]

```python
import numpy as np

a2 = a[np.newaxis, :]
print(a2, a2.shape)

# Convert 1D array to 2D column vector
a3 = a[:, np.newaxis]
print(a3, a3.shape)
```

```
[[1. 2. 3.]] (1, 3)
[[1.]
 [2.]
 [3.]] (3, 1)
```

(2) By `np.expand_dims`[^2]

```python
