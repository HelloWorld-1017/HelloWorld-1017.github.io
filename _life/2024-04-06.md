<br>

It's late in the evening

She's wondering what clothes to wear

She puts on her make-up

and brushes her long blond hair

And then she asks me "Do I look all right"

And I say "Yes you look wonderful tonight"

<br>

We go to a party and everyone turns to see

This beautiful lady is walking around with me

And then she asks me "Do you feel all right"

And I say "Yes I feel wonderful tonight"

I feel wonderful because I see 

The love light in your eyes

And the wonder of it all

Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

<br>

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head

So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed

And then I tell her as I turn out the light

I say "My darling you were wonderful tonight"

"Oh my darling you were wonderful tonight"
