When it comes to ‘weights’ (and ‘bias’) in the areas of Deep Learning, I think two characteristics should be kept in mind: *(random) initialization* at the beginning and *to be optimized* during the training process. If do this, one will not get lost, to some extent, when try to understand complex neural network structures and to derive those complicated computations.
